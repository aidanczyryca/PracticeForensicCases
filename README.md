These are two comprehensive reports on Autopsy's training resources on Windows computers, RAID servers, and thumb drives.
I have also done analysis on phones and Linux though these are not a part of these mock reports.
These are the first full reports I've done so I still have plenty of room to grow.
I would love to gain more experience working on phones in the future as it is a path I want to dive deeper into but I would gladly take any device.
