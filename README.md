# PracticeForensicCases
Autopsy's practice forensic case analysis on Windows computers, RAID servers, and thumb drives.
I have also done analysis on phones and Linux though these are not a part of these mock examination write ups.
These are the first full reports I've done so I still have plenty of room to grow.
I would love to work on phones in the future as it is a side I want to dive deeper into but I would gladly take any device.
